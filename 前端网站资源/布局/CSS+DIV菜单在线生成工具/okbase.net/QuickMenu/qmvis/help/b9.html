<div class="icontent">
Depending on your implementation, certain menu styles, such as active and sub settings are designed to be inherited by default. For example... all sub menu CSS styles are inherited from the main, and most sub menu add-on settings are also inherited from the main.
<br>
<br>
For most settings the interface will prompt you with a question asking if you would like the style to be inherited.  However, a few styles such as font family do not prompt, if you need to specify a different value for these settings you must specifically define it.
<br>
<br>
For the most part inheritance will help speed up the design process, as many settings in a typical menu are usually ment to be mirrored, such as main menu settings and sub menu font settings.
