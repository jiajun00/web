# How to contribute

Open to all bug reports, questions, and pull requests. 

## Goals of project

* To have a library that is dead simple to use
* To keep the amount of overall code to a minimum (we want the lowest overhead library as possible)
* To maintain absolute fallback where nojs or shitty engine will fall back to regular image loading
* To improve the web experience for people with slower internet access
* To have the blur effect be instantaneous
* To have browser coverage and support across the board
* To maintain perfect backwards compatibility

## Submitting a pull request

* Ensure it works on all browsers
* Run the script through [closure-compiler](https://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home) on Advanced to minify.
* Make your changes in a new git branch

     ```shell
     git checkout -b my-branch master
    ```

* Accept the universe's collective thanks for trying to make something a bit nicer


## Have a question or feature request or...?

* Check existing issues (google: `inurl:github.com/whackashoe/antimoderate MY PROBLEM`) to see if they answer
* If that doesn't work, post an issue with as much relevant information as possible

## Code of conduct

just kidding.
